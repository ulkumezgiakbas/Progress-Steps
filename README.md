# Progress-Steps
Hey there! ðŸŒŸ In this project, Iâ€™ve crafted a visually engaging progress steps component. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed a user-friendly progress bar with dynamic visual effects and animations for each of the four steps. Celebrate each completed step with an eye-catching confetti effect!
